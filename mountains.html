        Chimborazo
      </h1>
      <p>
        Chimborazo is a currently inactive stratovolcano in the Cordillera Occidental range of the Andes. Its last known eruption is believed to have occurred around 550 A.D.[4] With a peak elevation of 6,263 m (20,548 ft), Chimborazo is the highest mountain in Ecuador. Chimborazo’s summit is also the farthest point on the Earth’s surface from the Earth’s center given that it is located along the planet’s equatorial bulge. Chimborazo’s summit, therefore, is at a higher point than the summit of Mount Everest which is measured from sea level. Despite this, it is only the 39th highest peak in its own range.[5] Like Everest, Chimborazo is also known for climbing. Chimborazo’s climb demands skill and is often on black ice in which crampons and other high tech climbing equipment are required.

        Cotopaxi
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cotopaxi is an active stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains, located in the Latacunga canton of Cotopaxi Province, about 50 km (31 mi) south of Quito, and 33 km (21 mi) northeast of the city of Latacunga, Ecuador, in South America.[3] It is the second highest summit in Ecuador, reaching a height of 5,897 m (19,347 ft). It is one of the world's highest volcanoes.[4][5] Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by lahars (mudflows) around the volcano. The last eruption lasted from August 2015 to January 2016.[6] Cotopaxi was officially closed by the authorities to climbing until it reopened on October 7, 2017.
